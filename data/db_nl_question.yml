- question: Waarom geen 'interrupts'? Of mis ik iets?
  answer: Ik hou niet van interrupts! Probeer het in de plaats daarvan te zien als een schattige berichtenrij.

- question: Voor de instructies die meerdere cycli duren, is hat veilig om te veronderstellen dat ze geen waarden veranderen tot hun laatste cyclus?
  answer: Ik heb ze eigenlijk de waarden doen veranderen voordat ze enige cycli afleiden voor emulatie efficiëntie. Ze zijn gewoon een navoegsel.

- question: You don't have an 'ADD with Carry' instruction -- or at least, you should
    call 'ADD', 'ADC' since it does it implicitly
  answer: ADD just stores the carry in O, it doesn't use it. You have to apply it
    manually by doing ADD &lt;dest&gt;, O

- question: What the pitch?
  answer: In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space
    travel was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich individuals.<br/>In
    1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with all popular 16
    bit computers. Unfortunately, it used big endian, whereas the DCPU-16 specifications
    called for little endian. This led to a severe bug in the included drivers, causing
    a requested sleep of <code>0x0000 0000 0000 0001</code> years to last for
    <code>0x0001 0000 0000 0000</code> years.<br/>It's now the year 281 474 976 712 644
    AD, and the first lost people are starting to wake up to a universe on the brink of
    extinction, with all remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation long
    since ended, and massive black holes dominating the galaxy.
